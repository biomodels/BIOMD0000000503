Abstract:

We present the quantification and kinetic characterisation of the enzymes of
the pentose phosphate pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The data are
combined into a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of this system
and allows for the predicting changes in metabolite concentrations and fluxes
in response to perturbations. We use the model to study the response of yeast
to a glucose pulse. We then combine the model with an existing glycolysis one
to study the effect of oxidative stress on carbohydrate metabolism. The
combination of these two models was made possible by the standardized enzyme
kinetic experiments carried out in both studies. This work demonstrates the
feasibility of constructing larger network models by merging smaller pathway
models.
